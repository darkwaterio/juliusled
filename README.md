Julius ROV LED Array
==========

This is the repository for the PCB files for the Julius ROV LED Array. As well as the PCB you will need the following:

* 1 x 3 pin header
* 1 x Mosfet IRL540N or similar logic level Mosfet
* 1 x 10K 0805 resistor
* 1 x 1K 0805 resistor
* 7 x 100R 0805 resistors (or whatever you have calculated for the LEDs you are using)
* 7 x 5mm LEDs - I used these https://www.sparkfun.com/products/531

Solder the resistors first, then the LEDs then the other components - it makes things simpler :)
